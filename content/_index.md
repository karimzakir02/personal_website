## Hi!

**Welcome to my personal website**

My name is Karim Zakir. I am currently a 4th year student at the University of Toronto, majoring in data science. 

I am not quite sure yet what is going to be here. I am planning to publish some articles discussing my personal projects, as well as post about hobbies I do outside of work/school!

If you have any suggestions or any comments about my future articles, please email me at zakirkarim02 AT gmail DOT com. Thank you!
