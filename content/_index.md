## Hi!

My name is Karim Zakir. Welcome to my personal website!

#### About Me

I am a 4th year student at the University of Toronto, majoring in data science. Upon graduation, I intend to work as a software engineering analyst for [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) and their privacy platforms team!

I discovered my love for computer science in high school, when working on a course project for a VC fund in Abu Dhabi. Since then, I have worked in different roles, including software engineering and data science. I've felt comfortable in both the positions, but I am at my best when working somewhere in the intersection of the two. I love what I do, and I hope to share some of that love here with you!

If you have any suggestions or any comments about my articles, please email me at zakirkarim02 AT gmail DOT com. Thank you!
