      <description>Why? I have been meaning to start a personal website for a while to discuss any projects I have worked on or explore any ideas I found interesting. I never considered myself a writer, though, and didn&amp;rsquo;t think I would have fun writing articles/blogs, since I did not really enjoy writing in school. It&amp;rsquo;s not something that I hated - or even disliked - but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t my favorite activity either.</description>
